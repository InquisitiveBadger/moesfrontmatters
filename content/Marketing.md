Here you'll find game marketing showcases, plus one wellness/SaaS project. Both demonstrate how I approach marketing when the stakes extend beyond conversion metric, whether that's <span class="prose-link">[[moes-frontmatters/exclude-from-publish/marcomms-entries/FitIn.io|helping lower-income people stay fit during a pandemic]]</span> or[[The Otter Side|rebuilding communities after environmental disaster]]

**My current game marketing projects are in active development**. As a result, project pages focus on methodology deep-dives that cover my process of research and analysis of market positioning, target persona insights, competitive analysis, etc.
