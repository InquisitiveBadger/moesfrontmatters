%% ## The Optics of its Shutdown Isn't a Problem - It's an Opportunity

Company failure doesn't negate the quality of your work. In fact, this gives you a more compelling narrative than "we increased conversions by 23%."

## Reframe the "Results"

**Investor validation**: The product secured speculative investment based partly on the experience you designed. That's concrete proof of impact.

**Pre-launch traction**: Client/affiliate acquisition before official launch shows the UX was compelling enough to drive real business relationships.

**Market validation**: People were willing to commit resources based on what you built.

## The Story Arc

**Context**: Competitive fitness app market, need for differentiation  
**Challenge**: Create UX that drives both social engagement and business partnerships  
**Strategy**: Your approach, decisions, design philosophy  
**Impact**: Investment interest + affiliate partnerships secured pre-launch

## Why This Works Better

Failed startup case studies often showcase pure design thinking without the noise of external market factors. You can focus entirely on your process and decisions.

Plus, it positions you as someone who can create compelling experiences even in challenging circumstances - a valuable trait for game studios that often work with tight budgets and uncertain timelines.

## The Honest Framing

"While FitIn.io ultimately didn't continue operations due to operational challenges, the UX foundation attracted investor interest and secured partnerships before official launch."

Don't hide the failure - own it and show what you learned. What were the biggest UX insights from that project? %%
