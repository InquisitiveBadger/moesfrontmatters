## Frontmatters

This part of the site documents my experience with completed projects and works-in-progress through case studies, post-mortems, reflections, observations and everything in between.

It's also an ongoing process of learning in public. A way to show how I think and connect ideas across different domains. Many notes here are intentionally unfinished "seedlings," some as short as a single line, waiting to be expanded and connected via [[Wikilinks|wikilinks]].

My hope is to create a feedback loop where others can offer new perspectives that help this space grow. If it helps them too, all the better.

To that end, may this garden inspire your own 🍻

> Notes on WIPs delve into my creative process, not story ideas. But when something story-related is mentioned, expect abstractions, scénes à faire, and high-level musings on theme, tropes, genre conventions, and a fair amount of generic framing across the board (e.g. “Character A attacks B at restaurant”).
