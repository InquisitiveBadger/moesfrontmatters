Hello! I'm Moe Abbas, a Toronto-based game writer, designer and marketer who who's worked at the intersection of storytelling and interactive media for more than 10 years. My experience spans Development/Production in Film & TV, and Marketing/UX design in tech. I've also written for a bunch of different media and learned how to code (just enough) along the way.
